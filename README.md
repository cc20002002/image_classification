## Assignment 2 - Learning with Noisy Data

**Author** :Chen Chen, Yutong Cao, Yixiong Fang

**Lecturer**: Tongliang Liu

**Tutors** : Zhuozhuo Tu, Liu Liu

**Objectives:**

The goal of this assignment is to study how to learn with label noise. Specifically, you need to use at least two methods to classify real world images with noisy labels into a set of categories. Then, you need to compare the performance of these classifiers and analyze the robustness of label noise methods.
The datasets are quite large, so you need to be smart on which methods you gonna use and perhaps perform a pre-processing step to reduce the amount of computation. Part of your marks will be a function of the performance of your classifier on the test set.

**Reuirements:**
- sklearn >= 0.20.0
- multiprocessing
- numpy
- matplotlib
