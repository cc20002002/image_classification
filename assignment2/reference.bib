abstract="The support-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.",

  abstract = 	 {In adversarial classification tasks like spam filtering and intrusion detection, malicious adversaries may manipulate data to thwart the outcome of an automatic analysis. Thus, besides achieving good classification performances, machine learning algorithms have to be robust against adversarial data manipulation to successfully operate in these tasks. While support vector machines (SVMs) have shown to be a very successful approach in classification problems, their effectiveness in adversarial classification tasks has not been extensively investigated yet. In this paper we present a preliminary investigation of the robustness of SVMs against adversarial data manipulation. In particular, we assume that the adversary has control over some training data, and aims to subvert the SVM learning process. Within this assumption, we show that this is indeed possible, and propose a strategy to improve the robustness of SVMs to training data manipulation based on a simple kernel matrix correction.}
